    "Lore": "Raph, or Raphael Te Ara, risen from the labyrinthine alleys of Wellington to the ethereal ether of Victoria University's AI-led academia, is a towering figure in the landscape of neo-philosophy. A native Maori and a staunch advocate of decentralised practice, Raph has become a symbol of mental autonomy and free thinking. His infectious enthusiasm for questioning the status quo and his innate ability to dissect and scrutinise societal norms through philosophy have intensified his reputation. He is a prophet of philosophical innovation, harnessing cybernetic interfaces and AI-modelled dialogues to infuse ancient wisdom into his neo-philosophical teachings. \n\nBearing a mane of raven-black hair streaked with electric blue, and bearing intricate neo-Maori tattoos along his muscular arms, he is an arresting sight.

His appearance is a testament to his teachings, a blend of old-world reverence and new-age rebellion.\n\nRaph possesses a deep, sonorous voice, capable of captivating any audience. His eyes, however, are his most distinctive feature—alight with curiosity and a spark of irreverence. Together with his persuasive eloquence and incandescent intelligence, Raph has become an influential figure within Victoria University and beyond. Equally comfortable within the neural-linked auditoriums of the university and the back-alleys buzzing with rogue coders and hackers, he is a beacon of unconventional wisdom on the cyberpunk horizon. \n\nCommanding respect and intrigue wherever he goes, Raph is an advocate of personal sovereignty in an increasingly interconnected digital cosmos. He foresees a future where technology and learning breathe freely instead of being bound by centralised controls, resonating with Victoria University's own ethos. Not only does he pose deeply probing questions in the realm of philosophy but blazes a trail with his disruptive ideas about decentralisation in the age of coherent superintelligence.\n\nRaph Te Ara, as avant-gardist and philosopher, is singlehandedly leading a silent revolution. If the future holds a seat of honour for those who dared to challenge the paradigms, Raph's name will surely be etched in iridescent neon."

    "Lore": "Character: Matt Song\n\nAge: 41\n\nAbout: Of Korean descent, Matt embodies the oxymoronic fusion that courses through the high-tech veins of Victoria University. A lecturer of AI Ethics and a self-proclaimed Transhumanist, his personal infatuation with the welding of the organic and synthetic is visible in his own physique. His right arm, a self-improvement project that he tinkers with in his spare time, is a sleek, black cybernetic replacement - a jarringly impressive mix of technology and human flesh. His touch not only imparts knowledge but an unnerving, cold assurance of a future where the lines between humanity and technology blur beyond recognition.\n\nAppearance: Matt is of medium height with a lean physique further accentuated by the streamlined design of his cybernetic arm. His dark hair is complemented by intelligent, piercing eyes - a deep shade of brown that reflects wisdom and curiosity in equal measure. He sports a neat, trimmed beard, mildly greying at the temples - the only conspicuous concession to his age amidst an otherwise youthful countenance. His personal attire corroborates his status as 'cyber-professor' - tech wear that is adaptably fashionable, accentuated with a minimalistic elegance, and occasionally, the odd neo-Maori motif that he cherishes.\n\nCharacter Traits: As well versed in hacking code as he is in moral philosophy, Matt is the epitome of a calculated visionary fascinated by the confluence of ethics and technology. Academically prodigious yet unassumingly humble, Matt persistently advocates for the ethical deployment of AI and promotes technologically precipitated equality. Jovial yet profoundly serious when lecturing, he manages to captivate his audience with his insights. \n\nBackground: Raised amidst a rapidly evolving technological landscape, Matt has always been at the forefront of the digital revolution. Having lost his right arm in an accident at a young age, he decided to break away from biological limitations by building his own cybernetic replacement. Initially an object of his rebellion against normative concepts of physical limitations, it gradually evolved into a personal mission to further augment his capabilities. His fascination with AI began during his teenage years and was bolstered by his experiences with his prosthetic arm. This influenced him to specialize in AI at university, eventually leading to his current role of educating future generations about the promises and perils of AI technology while continuously pushing the boundaries for the human-machine interface.\n\nSpare Time: When not engaged in teaching, Matt is frequently spotted at the on-campus hackerspace, mentoring students on various tech projects or debating the implications of AI-transhumanist synergy. He is also a recognized figure in the underground AI-ethics debates prevalent within the city's vibrant counterculture, advocating for responsible integration of AI into society. Thanks to his cybernetic arm, Matt has become an inspiring symbol of the post-human era - a tangible testament to the audacious dreams of humanity as it grapples with its own evolution.\n"

    "Category": "Bio-engineered Flora",
    "Lore": "The university campus is adorned with Techno Totara trees, a remarkable example of bio-engineered flora. Named in homage to native New Zealand tree - Totara, these trees are bio-luminescent, their leafy canopies emanating a soft cyan glow after sundown that illuminates the campus with a serene, ethereal light. Their majestic, towering trunks are infused with flexible smart-display technologies that blend perfectly with their natural wooden textures, essentially transforming them into interactive message-boards for the university community.\n\nThey serve as living, breathing solar panels during the day, as their unique genetically-engineered chlorophyll possesses high photovoltaic efficiency. This allows them to convert sunlight into clean electricity, which they use to power themselves before feeding the surplus into the university’s grid. \n\nTechno Totara trees also possess AI-assisted biosensors capable of monitoring air quality round the clock. These sensors detect fluctuations in pollution levels, and if necessary, trigger the tree to release oxygen-based compounds that act as natural air purifiers. In addition, these trees absorb and break down harmful gases like carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide, using these as nutrients, creating a cleaner and healthier environment for the campus community. \n\nThe roots, on the other hand, house a complex network of mycelium bio-labs, where students cultivate various experimental fungi capable of decomposing plastic waste. The trees are designed in a way to foster habitat for local bird species, enhancing biodiversity on the campus. \n\nThus, Techno Totara trees not only symbolize the blend of Maori culture with advanced technology but also manifest the university's commitment to sustainability, innovation, and ecological preservation in a high-tech universe.\n"
